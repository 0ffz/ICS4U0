###### 1) What are the criteria for a recursive solution?

* There must be a way of reducing the problem to smaller repetitive elements

* There must be a way of identifying, recognizing and dealing with the end point of the solution

* There must be a way of achieving a larger result from the component elements

###### 2) Think of another everyday example. NOT mentioned on this assignment or during the lesson!



###### 3) Give two specific problems associated with recursion, and tow reasons for using recursion



###### 4) What does an iterative solution mean?
