## Factorial- Daniel Voznyy

##### Trace 1 = 5!

f() is being used as the method name instead of factorial() for simplicity

```
f(5);
= 5 * f(4);
= 5 * (4 * f(3));
= 5 * (4 * (3 * f(2)));
= 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * f(1))));
= 5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * f(0)))));
= 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
= 120
```
returns 120

##### Trace 1 = 7!

```
f(5);
= 7 * f(6);
= 7 * (6 * f(5));
= 7 * (6 * (5 * f(4)));
= 7 * (6 * (5 * (4 * f(3))));
= 7 * (6 * (5 * (4 * (3 * f(2)))));
= 7 * (6 * (5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * f(1))))));
= 7 * (6 * (5 * (4 * (3 * (2 * (1 * f(0)))))));
= 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
= 3600
```
returns 3600
